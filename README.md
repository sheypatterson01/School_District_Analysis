# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:

The point of this analysis is to take the inaccurate data for the 9th graders at Thomas High School and replace it, while keeping the rest of the data as it was orginally.

## Results:

Within this analysis editing the incorrect test scores of the 9th graders at Thomas High School did not change the over all data set and test scores by much. In fact, looking at the rest data set, it practically does not skew at all. Below is a picture of the orginal analysis; that includes the orginal scores in the 9th grade reading and math sections of Thomas High School.

## Thomas High School:

The table below, is from the most recent analysis, where the inaccurate math and reading scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School have been removed. The averages jumped from the 60% range to the 90% so the overall adjustment was fairly drastic in th the averages and percent passing. Outside of those two categories however, the data set remained the same.

## Summary:

The four major changes that occurred withing this analysis are: the number of total students, the number of students counted at Thomas High School, the average math and reading scores, and the overall percentages for math and reading at Thomas High School. The overall total amount of students was decreased, leading to a change in average scores and score percentages. These score and percentage changes are small in comparison to the rest of the analysis. With this in mind it is easy to see that though the percentage change was drastic the overall shift in the data was not nearly as large as one might have assumed.
